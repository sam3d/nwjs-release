# How to install
You can use npm to install:

```console
$ npm install -g nwjs-release
```

# How to use
You'll need to run the commands in the same directory as your node.js `package.json` file, which is where this gets the data from. For more information about versioning using this method, check out [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

Flags will be introduced in a later version but currently everything is done via an interactive wizard by running `nwjs-release`.

```console
$ nwjs-release
```
